AI NLP Project Spring/Summer 2014

These project folders contain the source code and example input files for two
implementations of distributional learning algorithms for context-free
grammars. Given a set of input sentences and an oracle (i.e. teacher/parent)
grammar, the algorithm constructs its own grammar representation in a
modified CFG format. The modified CFG format replaces lexical categories with
contextual representations.
